# Terra: Your Carbon Footprint Calculator

### [‚èØÔ∏è Watch the Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61v9ZJqV-gY)


### INSPIRATION üí°
Climate change is a problem that has been going on for decades. There is never any good news about it. As climate change continues to worsen, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent, and ocean levels begin to rise. Large companies and corporations from all over the world are contributing to more than 70% of global emissions. Analyzing this, the team became inspired to decrease emissions by providing companies with calculations based on statistics. Our goal is to inform industries of their global carbon footprint in hopes of recognition and correction.


### WHAT IT DOES üíª
Terra is a web-based application that allows users from all over the world to input company statistics and calculate their carbon footprint. Users are asked to provide statistics such as electrical energy consumption, gasoline consumption, and waste production. Using these three core stats, we can calculate the user's carbon footprint.


### HOW WE BUILT IT üõ†
We used Figma to design the prototype of the web page. We used HTML and CSS to design the front end of the website and Python with the Tkinter graphic user interface library to make our project functional.

# Our Takeaways

### CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO üò§
1. Timezones were a challenge for us. Three of the four-team members are from Canada whereas the fourth member is from the UK. Our daytime hours did not coincide well.
2. The three members from Canada had never attended a hackathon before. This was extremely difficult as we were inexperienced.
3. Two of the members had zero knowledge of web development. This was extremely difficult as we lacked the necessary skills for our project.

### ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'RE PROUD OF üòä
1. We are proud of our work. We created a web-based application that not only provides data but ultimately saves lives.
2. The green theme of the web inspires an overall message we are trying to convey.
3. We were able to implement programming and calculations to provide users with calculated information based on real data.

### WHAT WE LEARNED üìî
1. We learned how to use GUIs such as Tkinter.
2. We learned how to collaborate efficiently and work well with the skills each individual brings.
3. Some members learned front-end development using HTML and CSS.


# What's Next for Terra? üöÄ

### Notification System ‚ùóÔ∏è
We would like to implement an automatic notification system that provides users with information on their carbon footprint. This will further allow companies to redesign and implement new solutions to decrease their carbon emissions.

### Financial  Insight üí∞
Furthermore, we would also like to provide users with financial insight on how decreasing carbon emissions could increase profit. For example, if we notice a company is emitting a substantial amount of greenhouse gases via a large energy consumption, we can refer the company to invest in greener solutions such as solar panels to increase their profit.

### Website Design üé®

We would also like to improve the website and make it more visually appealing. Due to the website being made by first-time hackers learning throughout the 24 hour period, it is a feat we are proud of to have been able to take our Figma design and translate it onto paper. However, the code for the website has room to be optimized and organized. The website can be adjusted to contain perfectly responsive design to adjust for different screen sizes.
